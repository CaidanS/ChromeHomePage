# Chrome Home Page

Just a simple landing page made with Jim Schubert's new tab redirect [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna) pointing towards a local file, and using the [Mohammad H. Sattarian
](https://github.com/mhsattarian)'s [archillect API](https://github.com/mhsattarian/archillect-api) to grab interesting images. Slammed together in an afternoon, but I think it looks nice, even if the code doesn't :)

Important caveat: archillect does _very_ occasioanally return nsfw images, which I wish I had found out before screensharing for a presentation 

I'll probably integrate the canvas api at somepoint, but until then it is definitely an improvement over the default landing.
